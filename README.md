# Responsive-Portfolio

So I figured this would be a bit easier, turns out I was wrong and theres a bit more CSS involved than anticipated. 

I got the viewport meta tags put into place, and began to implement @media tags. Layout still needs to be implemented.

I suck at CSS, so this will be a big practice area for me going forward. 

Expect some commits after the due date time as I continue to work on this.
